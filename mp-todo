scheduler:
- process() can be called by more than one task (int 0xfe handler per cpu + scheduler task)
- task_setup() can be called by more than one task (TEMPORARY_MAP_ADDRESS is the problem)
- find_available_local()
- support priority-based futexes (threads can specify their priority, woken in priority order)
