Cases:
- Simple channel
    - single reader task, single writer task
    - only nonblocking
    - writer:
        - allocates ring space, writes packet, increments counter
    - reader:
        - checks counter, reads packet, releases ring space
- Multi channel (TODO)
    - multiple reader or writer tasks
    - supports blocking with sleeping
    - writer:
        - waits for ring space
        - allocates ring space
        - copies in packet
        - marks packet as ready
        - increments count semaphore
    - reader:
        - decrements count semaphore
        - checks head packet
